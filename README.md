# routermeter
Runs network speed tests when router is idling. Made 2015 to be ran with cron from Raspberry PI to track speed fluctuations of LTE-internet. Only supports one router Telewell Tw Eav510. Detects from the router if internet connection is on low usage and only runs if it is to prevent disturbing active connections.
